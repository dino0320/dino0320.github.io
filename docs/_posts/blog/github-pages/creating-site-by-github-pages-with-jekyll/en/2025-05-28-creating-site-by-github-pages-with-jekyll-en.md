This article is about creating a website by GitHub Pages with Jekyll.  
Jekyll is a static site generator. GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default to create and publish sites.

## Environment  
- Windows 10 64-bit  
- Git for Windows 2.44.0  
- Ruby 3.2.3  
- Jekyll 4.3.3  

## Prerequisites  
- Git is installed.  
- You have a GitHub account.  

## Steps to Create the Site  
1. [Install Jekyll](#1-install-jekyll)  
2. [Create a site on GitHub Pages](#2-create-a-site-on-github-pages)  
3. [Clone the GitHub repository](#3-clone-the-github-repository)  
4. [Create the site using Jekyll](#4-create-the-site-using-jekyll)  
5. [Check the site locally](#5-check-the-site-locally)  
6. [Commit and push the changes](#6-commit-and-push-the-changes)  
7. [Change the repository settings](#7-change-the-repository-settings)  
8. [View the site](#8-view-the-site)  

Based on the following page:  
[Creating a GitHub Pages Site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

## 1. Install Jekyll  
For details on installing Jekyll, see [here](/programming/ruby/installing-jekyll-on-windows-en).

## 2. Create a site on GitHub Pages  
For details on creating a GitHub Pages site, see [here](/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-en).

## 3. Clone the GitHub repository  
You will use Jekyll to create the site.  
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).  
If you are not signed in, sign in.  
2. Access the page of the repository you created.  
![Link to access the GitHub repository page](/assets/images/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-with-jekyll/image1.png "Link to access the GitHub repository page")  
3. Click “Code.”  
4. Copy the URL for cloning.  
![Clone URL](/assets/images/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-with-jekyll/image2.png "Clone URL")  
5. Clone the GitHub repository.  
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following:  
Replace `<directory path where to clone the repository>` with your desired path, and  
`https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git` with the clone URL you copied.
```
> cd <directory path where to clone the repository>
> git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```

## 4. Create the site using Jekyll  
1. Navigate to the repository directory.  
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
```
> cd <path to the repository directory>
```
`<path to the repository directory>` is `<directory where you cloned>/<repository name>`.

2. Delete the `README.md` file.  
If there is a `README.md` file in the root of the repository, delete it:
```
> git rm README.md
```

3. Create and move into the `docs` directory.  
Create the directory where you’ll generate the site and navigate into it:
```
> mkdir docs
> cd docs
```

4. Create the site with Jekyll.  
Generate a Jekyll site in the current directory (`docs`):
```
> jekyll new --skip-bundle .
```

5. Modify the `Gemfile`.  
Open the generated `Gemfile` in a text editor and make the following changes:  
Since GitHub Pages uses the `github-pages` gem, uncomment the following line:
```
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```
Add a version constraint like this:
```
gem "github-pages", "~> <github-pages version>", group: :jekyll_plugins
```
Replace `<github-pages version>` with the version listed under [Dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions.json).  

Comment out the line that defines `jekyll`, as it is already included in `github-pages`:
```
#gem "jekyll", "~> <jekyll version>"
```

6. Modify `_config.yml`.  
Open `_config.yml` in a text editor and update the following fields.  
Comment out any fields you do not want to display on your site.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| title | Enter your site’s title. |
| description | Enter a description for your site. |
| twitter_username | Enter your X (formerly Twitter) username. |
| github_username | Enter your GitHub username. |

7. Install the gems.  
To install the necessary gems, run:
```
> bundle install
```

## 5. Check the Site Locally  
1. Start a local server.  
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following:
```
> cd <path to the repository>/docs
> bundle add webrick # Run this if you are using Ruby 3.0 or later
> bundle exec jekyll serve
```

2. Access http://localhost:4000  
The homepage will be displayed as shown below.  
By default, the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme is used.  
“Welcome to Jekyll!” is the page generated by the `jekyll new` command.

## 6. Commit and Push the Changes  
1. Modify `.gitignore`  
GitHub Pages does not install using `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.  
So add the following lines to the generated `.gitignore`:
```
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
```

2. Commit and push the changes.  
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following:
```
> cd <path to the repository>
> git add docs/
> git commit -m "Add site created with Jekyll"
> git push origin main
```

## 7. Change the Repository Settings  
Modify the repository settings.  
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
2. Open the page for your created GitHub repository.  
![Link to access the GitHub repository page](/assets/images/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-with-jekyll/image1.png "Link to access the GitHub repository page")  
3. Click “Settings”  
![Settings button](/assets/images/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-with-jekyll/image4.png "Settings button")  
4. Click “Pages”  
![Pages button](/assets/images/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-with-jekyll/image5.png "Pages button")  
5. Under “Build and deployment,” change the root folder of the “Branch.”  
Select `/docs`.

## 8. View the Site  
Check the published site.  
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
2. Open the page for your created GitHub repository.  
![Link to access the GitHub repository page](/assets/images/blog/github-pages/creating-site-by-github-pages-with-jekyll/image1.png "Link to access the GitHub repository page")  
3. Click “Settings”
