This guide explains how to handle vulnerability warnings when running `npm ci`.

## Environment
- Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (WSL2 distribution)
- Docker Engine 28.4.0
- Amazon Linux 2023(OS of the Docker container)
- Node.js 24.13.1
- npm 11.8.0

When running `npm ci`, I encountered security warnings recommending `npm audit fix`.  
However, `npm audit fix` did not resolve the issue.  

`npm audit report` showed:

```
ajv  7.0.0-alpha.0 - 8.17.1
Severity: moderate
...
minimatch  <10.2.1
Severity: high
```

It said that above versions of packages had vulnerabilities.  
Even after updating the parent packages (e.g., `npm install --save-dev jest@latest`), these specific sub-dependencies often remained stuck on vulnerable versions because the parent packages still referenced the older versions.

To force these sub-dependencies to a safe version, I used the `overrides` field in the `package.json`.  
This feature allows you to specify a version for a dependency anywhere in your dependency tree.

`package.json`:

```json
{
...
  "overrides": {
    "ajv": "^8.17.1",
    "minimatch": "^10.2.1"
  }
}
```

After running `npm install`,  the vulnerabilities were resolved.

Note:  
The `overrides` field forcefully overrides package versions.  
Be sure to verify that all packages continue to function properly after applying this change.
